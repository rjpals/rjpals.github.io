        		<h1>Vinny the Chatroom Moderator</h1>
				<p>Vinny is the name we gave to a moderating bot for the instant messaging application Discord. Two of my friends and I created Vinny at an ISU Hackathon to replace a moderator bot that was being used in our Discord server, but was no longer being maintained. Vinny’s original goal was to perform basic moderating tasks such as preventing spam and harsh language. Eventually we added more features, such as the ability to play songs over the chat channel.</p>
				<p>I was in charge of writing Python code that would allow Vinny to access data from other websites via various API’s. I used API’s from Clarifai, Reddit, and other image websites to allow Vinny to access funny pictures and automatically post them in chat. In doing this, I learned a lot about ReSTful API’s and how to program in Python. </p>
				<p>Vinny helps reduce the workload of Discord server moderators so they can spend more time interacting with people on their servers. Vinny is on Github and currently moderates over 300 servers.</p>
				
				<h1>Mars Rover</h1>
				<p>The Mars Rover was the final project for CprE 288: Embedded Systems.</p>
				<p>The project involved programming a specialized Roomba to navigate a treacherous obstacle course, without being able to see the robot. </p>
				<p>I wrote most of the “Rover” code: the code that ran on the actual robot, while my teammates wrote most of the “Mission Control” code, which is the code that ran on the computer that was wirelessly connected to the robot. This project presented many unique challenges for one reason: the robot’s processor was incredibly simple, and the memory was very small. This forced me to rethink how I wanted to write a lot of my code, because complex solutions that took a lot of memory were simply not possible. </p>
				<p>While we probably won’t be putting a Roomba on Mars, there are many important applications of the same principles of embedded software that I learned during this project. The same principles of lightweight and reliable design can be applied to any low-cost embedded platform.</p>
